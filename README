NVDIMMSim: a reasonably accurate nonvolatile DIMM simulator.

Acknowledgements:
	General design (anything not flash specific) borrows heavily from DRAMSim Copyright (C) 2008-2009 Elliot Cooper-Balis and Paul Rosenfeld (overall structure is very similar and some code snippets and classes are copy+paste).

	Basic program structure and functions were designed and implemented by Peter Enns (<slunk at umd dot edu>)

Getting started:
	To run TraceBasedSim.cpp:

		cd src
		make
		./NVDSim

	To create a shared library:

		cd src
		make lib    // creates libnvdsim.so

Questions?
	Contact me at <pkt3c at umd dot edu>
